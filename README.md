 # Communication-using-WebRTC

In this project, I implemented **WebRTC Tool**, that is used to pervade the Real Time Communication (RTC) in mobile applications as well as in web browsers. It is used for sharing audio as well as video media between two distant browsers.

I created an application using WebRTC library and also leveraged the capabilities of libraries such as MediaStream, RTC Peer Connection and RTC Data Channel, for creating a peer-to-peer communication.
